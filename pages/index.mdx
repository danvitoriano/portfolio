# Dan Vitoriano

Hey, I'm a Senior Software Engineer and CEO at FRONTIN. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences, besides organizing event for the tech community.

This portfolio was built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

Check my YouTube channel and watch the video where I teach how to create and host a website like this in a couple of minutes an for free.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
